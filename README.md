# Netflix Movie Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python notebook (`Netflix AnalysisC_starcloud_doneFile.ipynb`) that performs an exploratory data analysis on a Netflix movie dataset. It utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:

* Filtering movies from the complete Netflix dataset.
* Analyzing movie durations and genre distributions.
* Visualizing the relationship between movie release year and duration using a scatter plot, with genre color coding.
* Determining trends in movie duration over time.

## Files

* `netflix_data.csv`: The Netflix movie dataset.
* `Netflix AnalysisC_starcloud_doneFile.ipynb`: The Jupyter/Colab notebook containing the analysis.

## Libraries Used

* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib: For data visualization.

## Visualizations

The primary visualization is a scatter plot showing movie duration versus release year, with colors representing different genres. This helps in understanding how movie durations and genre distribution have changed over time.

## Usage

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `Netflix AnalysisC_starcloud_doneFile.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3.  Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Findings

The analysis attempts to answer whether movies are getting shorter over time, with visualizations supporting the analysis.
